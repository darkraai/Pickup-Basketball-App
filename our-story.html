		<div id="story-text-container"><p class="story-text">The year was 2012, and our founder Benjamin Svoboda, used to go to his neighborhood basketball courts and play basketball with his friends. As he got older, many of his friends left pickup basketball for other sports, video games, and various hobbies. As a result, he joined the Ashburn Youth Basketball Rec. League, but the experience was never the same as playing in the neighborhood with all his closest friends. Something about it felt off. Sure, the camaraderie, energy, and lightheartedness that came with playing with his best friends was part of the story, but it wasn’t all. There was just something special about playing pickup basketball that could not be replaced, even if it was with complete strangers. For a while, he stopped playing basketball altogether and thought his love for the game faded. Then, in his junior year, an acquaintance from school invited him to hoop with him and his friends. They played for hours, and Ben had the time of his life. Afterwards, he realized that he never lost passion for basketball, but instead access to pickup games. </p><br> <pre class="tab"></pre><p class="story-text">Since that evening, pickup basketball has become one of my primary forms of exercise and a highlight of many of my days, without costing a cent. Consistently participating in pickup basketball games forced me to trust my teammates’ decisions, communicate with them effectively, and even empathize with them outside of the court. Consequently, these once random kids I was introduced to became some of my closest friends. Ironically, the acquaintance that brought me to that first pickup game is now the CTO of our company. </p><br> <pre class="tab"></pre><p class="story-text">These friendships would have never been forged if it weren’t for basketball. In fact, it was with these realizations that Hoop Break LLC was born. Since we were pickup basketball players ourselves, we were well aware of the challenges affecting the game. Most notably, the courts were often empty, so there would not be enough people for a 5 v 5 game, and there would frequently be much confusion amongst the group on where and what time they would be playing. An app that would make it seamless for users to schedule games with all the fun and none of the confusion was the perfect solution. </p><br> <pre class="tab"></pre><p class="story-text">Hoop Break’s goal is not only to allow users to easily join and schedule games, but to help users forge meaningful relationships and learn life skills through basketball, an opportunity I wish I had when I was younger.<br><br><b>Benjamin Svoboda - CEO, Co-founder</b></p></p></div>
