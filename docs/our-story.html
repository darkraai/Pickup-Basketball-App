		<div id="story-text-container"><p class="story-text">Every Friday, I used to go to my neighborhood basketball courts and to play basketball with my friends. As I got older many friends left casual basketball for other sports, video games, and hobbies. At the beginning of my high school career, I thought my love for playing basketball had faded. In my junior year, an acquaintance from school invited me to hoop with him and his friends. We played for hours, and I had the time of my life. Afterwards, I realized that I never lost passion for basketball, but access to games. Since that evening, pickup basketball has become one of my primary forms of exercise, while being a highlight of many of my days and without costing a cent. </p><br> <pre class="tab"></pre><p class="story-text"> Consistently participating in pickup basketball games forced me to trust my teammates’ decisions, communicate with them effectively, and even understand them better as people. Because of this, these once random kids I was introduced to became my close friends. These friendships would have never been forged if it weren’t for basketball, and the acquaintance that brought me to that first pickup game is now the CTO of Hoop Break.</p><br> <pre class="tab"></pre><p class="story-text"> However, we did have occasional problems while playing pick up. One was that sometimes the courts were empty so we’d have to play within each other instead of a 5 v 5 full court. Other times, there would be confusion within our group as to what time we were playing and at what court. Observing these problems among others, I came up with Hoop Break, an app that would make it seamless for users to schedule games with all the fun and none of the confusion. </p><br> <pre class="tab"></pre><p class="story-text"> Hoop Break’s goal is to allow users to not only easily join and schedule games, but to forge meaningful relationships and learn life skills through basketball, an opportunity I wish I had when I was younger.<br><br><b>Ben Svoboda - CEO, Co-founder</b></p></p></div>
