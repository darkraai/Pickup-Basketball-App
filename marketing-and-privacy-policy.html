			<p class = "m-p-text">Please find attached our official company media press kit, which has access to our official press release for our app, our story, app store description, team bio's, app screenshots, and more. It's the <b>ONE-STOP PLACE</b> for media reporters and journalists to learn about our company, founding philosophies, and business model.</p>

			<h3><a href="https://www.instagram.com/hoop.break/">Instagram</a></h3>
			<p class="m-p-text">Our Instagram posts aim to provide quality basketball analysis of NBA teams. Currently, we are providing an in-depth analysis of the basketball teams currently playing in the NBA bubble in Orlando, Florida. Each day we provide a discussion for a new NBA team and answer any comments that get thrown our way. This is our primary form of social media, and we hope to draw our basketball-oriented users to our app by providing them with quality content. <br><br>Examples of some of our posts:</p>

			<h3><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/hoopbreak/">Twitch</a></h3>
			<p class="m-p-text">Our twitch channel is our second mode of social media marketing. Here, we live stream NBA games with an NBA Playmakers License and provide commentary and a play-by-play analysis of the game. In contrast to the regular NBA commentators who merely state what is going on in the game such as pointing out a flasher dunk or three pointer, our commentary dives into a complete breakdown of the game using next-level statistics from Basketball Reference, a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of both teams, and the different offensive and defensive gameplans/strategies the competing teams use. This provides the much-needed context for our audience to better understand what they are watching and improves their basketball game-sense. <br><br>Currently we have one 3-hour Twitch livestream covering the 9PM Lakers v. Jazz game on Monday, August 3rd (see below): </p>

			<h3><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hoopbreak?lang=en">TikTok</a></h3>
			<p class="m-p-text">This is one of our newer social media platforms, and we decided to go with it because a large number of our app userbase is young, and the number one social media platform following Instagram is TikTok, a revolutionary way to provide video content for the masses. Most of our content lies in entertaining skits and ranking compilations. <br><br>Our newest TikTok rates the “drip”, or sense of fashion, of famous NBA players:</p>

			<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCII6a2OrYxmHNOkx4RUfzfw?disable_polymer=true">Youtube</a></h3>
			<p class="m-p-text">This is our newest social media addition, and it is a place where we clip Twitch livestreams in case our followers miss them and provide original content such as determining value in the NBA using advanced metrics or breaking down the difference between different NBA team’s defensive schemes. Since YouTube has the most growth potential out of any of our current social media platforms, we plan on prioritizing it for the foreseeable future. Since we just started the YouTube channel, we currently do not have any videos uploaded. </p>
